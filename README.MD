## Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enables users to upload data (CSV or JSON files), store it in a Chroma vector store, and interact with it through a chatbot powered by Gemini (version `gemini-1.5-pro`). The chatbot retrieves relevant data from the uploaded files, enhances the user queries, and returns responses using LLMs.

## Features
1. **Upload CSV or JSON files** – Auto-detects and allows users to select columns for vector search.
2. **Store and retrieve vector embeddings** using Chroma.
3. **Interactive chatbot** using the Gemini API to generate responses based on user queries and stored data.
4. **Customizable LLMs** – Select columns that the LLM should answer from.

## Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure that the following are installed:

### Python packages:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `uuid`
- `os`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `chromadb`
- `google-generativeai`
- `IPython`

### Installation steps:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas uuid sentence-transformers chromadb google-generativeai IPython
```

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the application on `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Steps to Use:
1. **Upload Data**: Upload a CSV or JSON file. Select the column that should be indexed for vector search.
2. **Save Data**: The file will be saved into the Chroma vector store along with vector embeddings generated by the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
3. **Setup LLMs**: Enter your Gemini API key to configure the chatbot for generating responses.
4. **Chat**: Start interacting with the chatbot, which will retrieve and augment responses with data from the uploaded file.

## Notes:
- You will need a **Gemini API key** to set up the chatbot.
- Ensure that data is saved in the Chroma vector store before interacting with the chatbot.

## Troubleshooting:
- If no data is retrieved during a query, ensure you have selected the correct columns to answer from.
- Make sure the API key is valid and the collection has been initialized before interacting with the chatbot.
